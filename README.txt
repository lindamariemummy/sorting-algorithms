This repo contains examples of code implementing bubblesort, binarysort, quicksort, and mergesort.

These examples are merely to show the algorithms and contain NO GUI OF ANY KIND. To run a sorting algorithm on your own data set you need to modify the html file. Enable the JavaScript console in order to see the sorted data.

Next sorting algorithm on my agenda: heapsort.
